Jack-o'-lanterns are carved by children and enthusiasts alike on Halloween. The tradition can also be thought to help guide the lost soul himself.\n The legend, however, goes back further than the term itself. Jack-o'-lantern or some variation thereof was at the height of usage in 17th century Europe. Simply put, it meant \"the guy with the lantern.\" Later the term would almost exclusively be used as slang in reference to the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon, or ignis fatuus, due to the appearance of a far off person carrying a lantern."

They resemble a black crane, and if a person is caught sleeping in a temple's sermon hall, the onmoraki will rebuke them while flapping its wings. Onmoraki are also said to shout the Degeneration Sutra in the household altar of priests who neglect to read their sutras.\n In modern Japanese art, the onmoraki will often take on the comical appearance of a roasted chicken. This is most likely due to the works of a eighteenth century artist, Toriyama Sekien.\n"

Associated with skiing, hunting and winter, she is the daughter of Thjazi, one-time wife of the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, and stepmother of Freyr and Freya.\n In The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets authored by Barbara G. Walker in 1983, Skadi was said to be a Celtic goddess who carries the meaning of darkness and shadow, and thus an equivalent to the Irish Scathach. Today, many unique interpretations of mythological figures including Skadi and Mem Aleph by Walker are largely dismissed as unreliable, but her influence has already been spread to modern popular culture including the Megami Tensei series. Not only Skadi's design by Kazuma Kaneko which is completely black from head to toe, in the Japanese version of all games of the series, Skadi's background commentary recycles the same prose which cites Walker's theory without mentioning Skadi's origin as a Norse snowshoe goddess.\n"

Reborn as Parvati, daughter of the snow mountain god Himalayas, she sought Shiva out. Because the gods required Shiva's offspring to defeat their fierce adversaries, they sacrificed Kama in order to stoke Shiva's suppressed desire for a female partner. The two reunited eventually and together gave birth to Kartikeya and later on, Ganesha. They have the ability to merge into the half-male, half-female Ardha.\ufeff\n"

In addition to wine-making, he is the patron deity of agriculture and the theater. Hailed as an Asiatic foreigner, he was thought to have had strong ties to the East and to Ethiopia in the South. He was also known as the Liberator, freeing one from one's normal self, by madness, ecstasy or wine. The divine mission of Dionysus was to mingle the music of the aulos and to bring an end to care and worry. Scholars have discussed Dionysus' relationship to the \"cult of the souls\" and his ability to preside over communication between the living and the dead."

Cu Chulainn trained in war under the goddess Scathach, who lives in the Land of Shadows, and earned the magic spear Gae Bolg. At the age of seventeen, he defended Ulster single handedly against the armies of Queen Mab of Connacht in the epic Tain Bo Cuailnge. It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but that his life would be short; one reason he is compared to the Greek hero Achilles. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, in which he becomes an unrecognizable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Laeg, and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend."

Kimpusen Japan's Nara prefecture and is considered the local Japanese Shinto manifestation of three Buddhist divinities: the Historical Buddha, Kannon Bodhisattva and Miroku Buddha, who served respectively as the Buddhas of the Past, Present and Future. This makes Zaou perhaps the most powerful local divinity of religious mountain worship in Japan."

She was unique among deities worshiped by the Greeks as she had a transgendered, or eunuch, priesthood.

She is known as the \"Queen of Heaven\" and is the personification of the morning star (Venus). Her father is usually said to be Sin, the moon god, and she forms an astral trinity with him and her twin brother Shamash, the sun god. Other texts sometimes refer to Anu, Enlil or Ea (Enki) as her father. She is also known as the \"Lady of Battles\" because of her violent and warlike character. Her holy city was Uruk (or Erech). Part of her cult was thought to be devoted to temple prostitution, though despite Ishtar's sexual character, some modern researchers question this claim or the scope of such practices. Her symbols were the eight pointed star (originally simply a Mesopotamian symbol of heaven, but in later times only of the morning star), the lion and the dove. Like most Mesopotamian gods, art often depicts her wearing a horned crown, a symbol of divinity. She was commonly depicted as winged."

Regin was the brother of Otr and Fafnir and son of Hreidmar. Otr was killed by the Aesir after they mistook him for an otter, and as compensation had his body stuffed with gold. Fafnir then killed Hreidmar and stole the \"Otr's Gold,\" and to better guard it, turned himself into a dragon.\n Sigurd met Odin on his way, who advised the hero to dig trenches to drain the dragon's blood, which apparently gave him invulnerability. He killed Fafnir when the dragon walked over the trench, and bathed himself in the blood. However, a leaf had fallen and stuck itself on his shoulder. When he drank some of the blood, he understood the language of the birds and learned that Regin was plotting his death. As retaliation, he killed Regin first.

As the preserver, Vishnu maintains balance within the world, and at the end of our current era he will appear as his final avatar Kalki and judge whether mortals have been good or evil. After this, the universe will end and creation will start anew. He is depicted with up to four arms, blue skin, holding a chakra wheel, a lotus flower, a mace and a conch, and rides on the back of Garuda. He also sleeps on the back of a great Naga named Ananta Shesha.\n"

Chiyou was then beheaded by Yinglong (\u61c9\u9f8d), one of the Yellow Emperor's top generals.\n He is worshiped in China as the god of war and weapons and, along with Huang Di, as one of the progenitors of the Chinese people. Qin Shi Huang (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687), the First Emperor of China, worshiped Chiyou and attributed him to his success in conquering his rival states. Liu Bang (\u5289\u90a6), the founder of the Han dynasty, was also noted to have worshiped at Chiyou's shrine before his decisive battle with Xiang Yu (\u9805\u7fbd)."

Feeling grateful, Chyavana told them of a feast hosted by Indra, where the gods would drink the life elixir soma to retain their immortality. Apparently Indra did not allow the twin deities to enter as they had dabbled with mortals for too long. Saddened, they reported this to the sage, who decided to offer sacrifices to the twin deities to signify their godhood. This infuriated Indra, who attacked the sage with thunderbolts and mountains. Chyavana countered by summoning Mada, who was so enormous that its two sets of jaws could swallow the earth and heavens at the same time. Indra, worried that the gods are still in the heavens, surrendered and allowed the Asvin twins to join the feast."

He rebelled when he realized that Yaldabaoth was not the true God and granted humanity the knowledge to liberate themselves from Yaldabaoth. In other traditions, he is said to have created the material universe as a second heaven to rule over and became the \"God\" of the Old Testament, making him an interpretation of the Yaldabaoth.\n According to the beliefs of the Cathars, a notorious medieval heretical creed, Satanael (or Satanel) was the angelic name of Satan before Michael the archangel removed the -el suffix (signifying the loss of his angelic nature) and sealed him in Hell. In this interpretation, Satanael is the radical opposite of God and the ruler of the material world.\n"

It wears two long chains across its left and right shoulders, forming a cross.\n The Reaper acts as a security system for areas where Shadows infest, such as Tartarus and Mementos. It either actively pursues threats as they linger in an area for too long or ambushes them inside treasure chests or other objects that might otherwise contain valuable items, such as Power Spots. In Persona Q, however, it does not act any differently than other F.O.Es. In all of its appearances, it is incredibly powerful. Boasting an extensive array of skills that ranges from Physical skills, Elemental and Almighty magic, and status and buffs, it is highly unpredictable and difficult to beat via normal means. Despite its low HP compared to most end-game bosses, its other stats are abnormally high, making it incredibly fast, durable and hard-hitting.\n Unlike most other on-field Shadows where it is encountered, the Reaper uses its own model upon spawning on the map.\n The Reaper's origins are largely unknown. However, in Persona Q alone, they are said to be deployed by Chronos to wipe out any threats against divine providence.\n"
